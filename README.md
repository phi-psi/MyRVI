# MyRVI

What's that?
------------
MyRVI is my RISC-V Implementation. As an absolute Noob I will try to ... ehm,
I mean I will implement the RV32I instruction set of the RISC-V architecture.


What?
-----
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture designed by researchers
at University of California, Berkeley, and other volunteering contributors.
Besides of OpenRISC RISC-V is available free for everyone. I think RISC-V is
a nice sandbox to play with.


Why?
----
Because I want to. I want to learn how processors work and I think the best
method to achieve this goal is learning by doing. Publishing my pieces of work
direct to the public should be a fillip to finalize this endeavour. I think
RISC-V is an ascent technology and before I design some stupid processor
components by myself it would be nice to tell them what to do with a nice, well
structured instruction set.


How?
----
I read the RISC-V Instruction Set Manual and implement something that is
capable of executing the instructions mentioned there. I use VHDL because I
have seen RISC-V implemented only in verilog so far and because I grunt VHDL
more fluently than verilog.


Really?
-------
Please understand that I will look at your patches and commits only when
everything is finished. To increace the learning effect I think it would
be better to find solutions for the implementation by myself. But if you see
something really stupid or a dead end, please feel free to comment with a link
teaching how it's realy done.
